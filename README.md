1) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  
  Our client was The Gaming Room. This client was seeking a digital solution for managing their gaming application business as it expands. The requirement was a comprehensive system that allowed for customer registration, game inventory management, reservation scheduling, and payment processing. The clients focuses were on creating a seamless experience for their customers and needed the software userfriendly and effecient. 

2) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   
Clearly outlining what the client required and translating them into technical specs was a strong suit. I also payed attention to details allowing every aspect of the softwares functions to be documented thouroughly. I also emphasized the importance of the users experience through the design aligning features with client's vision. 

3) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   
The design document was a huge help in providing a structural approach to the software design process. The document was a served as a timeline, guiding the development team and ensuring everyone had a shared understanding of the requirements. 

4) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   
My area for revision would be in the error handling and edge cases. I addressed common scenarios, but felt that there were more comprehensive error areas to explore. Potential errors and how the system should then respond to them would make the document more robust. 

5) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   
Understanding what the user needed was of upmost importance in shaping the softwares design. With knowing the clients business model, target demographic, and their expectations. This allowed me to design features that directly catered to their users. Prioritizing what the end user wants ensured that the final product was intuitive, making it more likely to succeed. 

6) How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

A combination of understanding the requirements, conducting research on end users, and employing iterative design techniques. I focused on creating a user centered design, coducting usability tests and incorporating feedback to refine the softwares features. In the future usability testing and feedback sessions could help further develope the software. In the future I could see myself using all of these strategies.
